# Vision Utils:
Lightweight utilities for computer-vision projects
#### Bounding Boxes
* Bounding box operations, such as intersection over union
#### Images 
* Various image cropping methods.
#### Common Datasets (under construction, not quite ready yet)
* Simple utility for creating coco-style compatible datasets. This is useful for projects
that require such a format, such as [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark).
