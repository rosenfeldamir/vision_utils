Lightweight utilities for computer-vision projects
#### Training:
* simple_training : Very simple training / testing / logging loop for image classification. 

#### Bounding Boxes
* boxutils : Bounding box operations, such as intersection over union
#### Images 
* Various image cropping methods.
#### Common Datasets (under construction, not quite ready yet)
